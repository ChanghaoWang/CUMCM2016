Problem:

On February 21, 2016, the State Council issued “Several Opinions on Further Strengthening the Urban Planning and Construction Management”. In which the Article 16 recommended that the street community system will be implemented and the gated communities will not be established in the future of urban planning, while those old communities should gradually connect their roads to the public roads. This article has attracted wide attention and discussion.

Except for the public safety risk, one of the focuses in this discussion is whether it can optimize the structure of the road network and improve the road capacity by opening the gated communities. If this policy is effective, what effect it would bring? Some people think that the gated communities may result in a traffic jam due to the fact that such communities have influenced the structure of the road network of urban and blocked the “capillaries” of urban. Once the gated communities were opened to the public, the density and the area of the road network would be improved, and naturally, the road capacity would be advanced. But other people argue that the traffic conflict between the main road and the community road will also increase after the gated communities are opened and thus the traffic speed may be influenced. It is generally acknowledged that whether this policy is effective depends on the size of the gated community, the location of the gated community and the traffic condition inside and outside the gated community.

The Urban Planning and Traffic Management Department hopes your team to help them build a mathematical model to study the road capacity of the surrounding roads of the gated community when the policy of opening the gated communities is implemented. Your specific tasks are:

1. Please develop appropriate evaluation index system to evaluate the policy's influence on the surrounding traffic.

2. Please develop a traffic mathematical model. Analysis the traffic conditions of the surrounding roads after the gated communities are opened.
